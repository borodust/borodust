## What's happening

### alien-works
* Game Foundation [framework](https://github.com/borodust/alien-works) for Common Lisp
* Android [port](https://github.com/borodust/alien-works-android-runtime) for it
* Uses a lot of C and C++ libraries which is a perfect ground to also polish
  `:claw`

### claw
* C++ support polishing

### cl-bodge and trivial-gamekit
* On hold for now: heavy focus is on `:claw` C++ support
* Once initial C++ work on `:claw` is mainlined, I'm going to try to port
  `cl-bodge`/`trivial-gamekit` onto Android with `alien-works`
